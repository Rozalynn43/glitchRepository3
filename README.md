# Hello Website (blank)

This is a basic static HTML starter personal portfolio you will build through guided and instruction and self discovery.  

No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen 🪄 immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site, known as your homepage.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.
